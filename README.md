## Running the Project
### On Host Machine
1. **Frontend Setup:**  
   - Navigate to `xwiggy-app`:  
     ```bash
     cd xwiggy-app
     ```
   - Build and serve the Angular app:  
     ```bash
     ng build
     ng serve
     ```
   - Access the frontend at: `http://localhost:4200`

2. **Backend Setup:**  
   - Start your MySQL server and create the database:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     source src/main/resources/dbScripts/ddl.sql
     ```
   - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` if the MySQL port differs.  
   - Start the Spring Boot application:  
     ```bash
     cd xwiggy-back
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
   - Access the backend at: `http://localhost:8080`
